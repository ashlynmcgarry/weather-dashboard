This Weather Dahsboard allows user to enter their city and view not only the current weather but a five day forecast. Displayed weather includes the city, dates, temperature, humidity and wind speed as well as an icon that visually shows the weather conditions. Uesr's search history is displayed on page so they can easily revist previous searches. On page refresh, the search history remains in place. Throughout this project I learned was able to learn and utilise a range of jquery and bootstrap functions as well as implement server-side API fetch requests.
